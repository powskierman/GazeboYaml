- **Status Sensors** (timer active, stove active, sensor health)
- **Control Switches** (manual run, manual stop, temperature averaging)

## Hardware Requirements

### Required Components
1. **ESP32 Development Board**
2. **DS18B20 Temperature Sensor** (connected to GPIO13)
3. **Relay Module** (connected to GPIO12) - controls propane stove
4. **Nextion Display** (UART - TX: GPIO17, RX: GPIO16)

### Pin Assignments
```
GPIO12  - Relay Output (Propane Stove Control)
GPIO13  - DS18B20 Temperature Sensor (OneWire)
GPIO16  - Nextion RX
GPIO17  - Nextion TX
GPIO21  - I2C SDA
GPIO22  - I2C SCL
```

## Configuration

### 1. DS18B20 Sensor Address

**IMPORTANT:** You must replace the placeholder address in `gazebo_page3_thermostat.yaml`:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: dallas
    address: 0x000000000000  # ⚠️ REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL ADDRESS
```

To find your DS18B20 address:

1. Upload the configuration with the placeholder address
2. Check the ESPHome logs when the device boots
3. Look for: `Found dallas device at address 0x123456789ABC`
4. Copy that address into the configuration file
5. Re-upload the configuration

### 2. Default Settings

The thermostat comes with sensible defaults that can be adjusted via Home Assistant:

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Desired Temperature | 21°C | 10-35°C | Target temperature |
| Hysteresis | 1.0°C | 0-5°C | Temperature deadband |
| Temperature Correction | 0°C | -10 to +10°C | Calibration offset |
| Schedule Start | 08:00 | 00:00-23:59 | Heating schedule start time |
| Schedule End | 22:00 | 00:00-23:59 | Heating schedule end time |
| Manual Run Timeout | 120 min | 0-480 min | Auto-disable manual run |
| Temperature Averaging | ON | ON/OFF | Average with previous reading |

### 3. Nextion Display Configuration

The thermostat uses **Page 3** of the Nextion display with the following components:

| Component | ID | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|------|---------|
| `n0` | Desired Temp | Number | Shows target temperature |
| `n1` | Actual Temp | Number | Shows current temperature |
| `Slider0` | Temperature Slider | Slider | Allows setting desired temp |

The system automatically syncs temperature values between Home Assistant and the Nextion display.

## Operation Modes

### Automatic Mode (Default)

The thermostat operates automatically based on:

1. **Home/Away Status** - Must be "Home"
2. **Timer Status** - Must be within scheduled time
3. **Temperature** - Actual vs. Desired comparison

**Heating Logic:**
- Turn ON when: `Actual Temp < Desired Temp`
- Turn OFF when: `Actual Temp >= Desired Temp + Hysteresis`

### Manual Run Mode

Forces the stove **ON** regardless of:
- Temperature readings
- Schedule settings
- Home/Away status

**Safety:** Automatically disables after configured timeout (default 2 hours)

### Manual Stop Mode

Forces the stove **OFF** regardless of all other conditions.

**Priority:** Manual Stop always takes precedence over Manual Run

### Away Mode

When set to "Away":
- Stove is immediately turned OFF
- Remains OFF regardless of temperature or schedule
- Automatically resumes normal operation when set back to "Home"

## Control Priority

The system evaluates conditions in this order (highest to lowest priority):

1. **Manual Stop** → Always OFF
2. **Manual Run** → Always ON (with timeout)
3. **Away Status** → Always OFF when away
4. **Timer Status** → OFF if outside schedule
5. **Temperature** → Normal hysteresis control

## Temperature Sensing

### Error Handling

The DS18B20 sensor includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Bad Read Detection**
   - Checks for NaN values
   - Validates temperature range (-40°C to +85°C)
   - Tracks consecutive bad reads

2. **Sensor Failure**
   - After 3 consecutive bad reads, reports failure to HA
   - Continues using last known good temperature
   - Automatically recovers when sensor starts working

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Limits temperature changes to 1°C per update cycle
   - Prevents spurious readings from causing rapid cycling

4. **Optional Averaging**
   - Can average current reading with previous reading
   - Smooths out temperature fluctuations
   - Enable/disable via Home Assistant switch

### Temperature Correction

The temperature correction offset allows you to calibrate the sensor:

```
Displayed Temperature = Raw Temperature + Correction Offset
```

**Example:**
- If sensor reads 20.0°C but actual is 21.0°C
- Set correction to +1.0°C
- System will display and use 21.0°C

## Time-Based Scheduling

### Schedule Configuration

Configure via Home Assistant number entities:

- **Start Time**: Seconds from midnight (e.g., 28800 = 08:00 AM)
- **End Time**: Seconds from midnight (e.g., 79200 = 10:00 PM)
- **Days of Week**: Bit flags (currently all days enabled)

### Schedule Behavior

- **Within Schedule**: Timer Active = True, heating allowed
- **Outside Schedule**: Timer Active = False, stove OFF
- **Day Selection**: Can enable/disable specific days of week

**Helper Conversion:**
```
Hours to Seconds: Hours × 3600
Minutes to Seconds: Minutes × 60
Example: 8:30 AM = (8 × 3600) + (30 × 60) = 30,600 seconds
```

## Home Assistant Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Sensor Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- "Temperature Sensor Failure" binary sensor is ON
- Temperature shows NaN or invalid values

**Solutions:**
1. Check DS18B20 wiring (Data → GPIO13, VCC, GND)
2. Verify 4.7kΩ pull-up resistor between Data and VCC
3. Confirm correct sensor address in configuration
4. Check sensor logs for error messages

### Stove Won't Turn On

**Check in order:**
1. Manual Stop switch is OFF
2. Home Status is "Home"
3. Timer is "Active" (within schedule window)
4. Temperature is below target
5. Relay is functioning (check GPIO12 output)

### Stove Won't Turn Off

**Check in order:**
1. Manual Run switch is OFF
2. Temperature has reached target + hysteresis
3. Timer hasn't ended
4. Away mode not activated

### Nextion Display Not Updating

**Solutions:**
1. Verify UART connections (TX ↔ RX crossed properly)
2. Check baud rate is 9600
3. Verify page 3 components exist (n0, n1, Slider0)
4. Review Nextion logs for communication errors

### Manual Run Won't Disable

**Possible causes:**
1. Timeout set to 0 (disabled)
2. Switch not turning off properly
3. Check logs for timeout messages

**Solution:**
- Manually toggle the Manual Run switch OFF in Home Assistant
- Check `manual_run_timeout` setting

## Advanced Customization

### Changing Update Intervals

Edit `gazebo_page3_thermostat.yaml`:

```yaml
# Main control cycle (default: 10 seconds)
interval:
  - interval: 10s  # Change this value

# Health monitoring (default: 60 seconds)
  - interval: 60s  # Change this value
```

### Adding Nextion Visual Indicators

Add visual feedback in the control logic:

```yaml
heat_action:
  - switch.turn_on: gazebo_relay
  - lambda: |-
      // Add your visual indicator here
      id(nextion0).send_command("three.heating_led.val=1");
```

### Customizing Hysteresis Behavior

The hysteresis value can be adjusted in real-time via Home Assistant. For different heating/cooling strategies, modify the control logic in the main interval.

### Adding Additional Sensors

Add more temperature sensors for averaging:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: dallas
    id: ds18b20_temp_2
    address: 0x_YOUR_SECOND_SENSOR_ADDRESS
```
